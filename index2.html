        <h2 class="h2-2">About Us</h2>
        <p class="p-2">My name is Austin Cordova and my companion is Adrian Avina. I have been in the foster system for about 7 years now. I've seen some things in the system that need changing. Just a year ago I realized what and how these things should be changed. Myself and with the help from my friend Adrian, we are going to make a change. This is how we start.</p>
       <h2>Who am I Exactly?</h2>
        <p class="p-2">My name is Austin Cordova. When I was 11 years old, I got put in this place called Valley of the Moon. Valley of the Moon is a chidrens shelter. It's meant to be a temporary placement until you find a foster home. I was there for a few months until being bounced from placement to placement. I am currently 20 years old and am still in the foster system. I have been able to see past all the negative thoughts and try and make a change.</p>
        <h2>Who Is Adrian?</h2>
        <p class="p-2">Adrian is 20 years old and has never been the foster system. Him and I have been friends going on 6 years now. He has pretty much been through the system with me, not physically but emotionally. He's seen the struggles, and in seeing them he wants to help me make a change.</p>
